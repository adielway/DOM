        <h2>My Soulmate, My Langga,</h2>
        <p>This might be a little late(as always na naman), but I want you to know, I never forgot about you, not even for a second. </p> 
          <p>Even with my hectic schedule and barely 3 hours of sleep, you’ve been on my mind from the moment I woke up, while I was in class and exam. 
          If you’re reading this now, I know this is the perfect moment for you to hear my heart...</p> 

        <p>Thank you for staying.Thank you for believing in us, that what we have now will grow into something even more beautiful in the future.</p> 
          <p>I know you understand what I mean, especially when I say this is about your promise to little Banban.
         I'll be waiting for you, langga. 🫡</p> 

        <p>Again and again (Palagi?), I can’t help but feel how our actions, our timing jd, and even our little moments aligns so perfectly.</p> 
          <p>Like the universe has its own way of bringing two us together. 
          Just like how we met, and how we slowly get to know each other day by day.</p> 

        <p>It’s as if all we had to do was wait for the right moment… and the world gave us "you and me." </p> 
          <p>That’s exactly how I feel whenever I’m with you, langga.</p> 

        <p>Whenever I'm with you, just sitting side by side, my heart feels so much joy and happiness.</p> 
         <p>Well… maybe not always happy, kasi you still love to “mangaway” me 😅 but because of that I find so irresistibly cute about you. 😗</p> 

        <p>I want to be with you every single day, langga.</p> 
         <p>I want to be in your presence as each sunrise comes and goes, forever.</p>

        <p>I’m beyond lucky to have you.
          You are what it feels like to meet your soulmate.</p>

         <p>I love you so much, palangga!</p>
